# Welcome 🐛 {.center-text-title}

<p class="center-text-about">

Welcome to my page! I am a budding environmental data scientist ready to tackle questions about conservation and the ever-changing landscape. Outside of coding, I spending my time [bird watching](https://briana-barajas.github.io/about.html#bird-watching), swimming, and reading.
