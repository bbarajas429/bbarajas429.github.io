# Welcome 🐛 {.center-text-title}

My name is Briana Barajas, and I am a current graduate student working on my Master of Environmental Data Science. I enjoy learning about plants and their fascinating biotic relationships. When I'm not at the computer I enjoy running, birding, and updating my bullet journal.
