# Welcome 🐛 {.center-text-title}

My name is Briana, and I'm a budding data scientist, working on my Master of Environmental Data Science. I love learning about birds, bugs, microbes and all things nature. When I'm not at the computer I enjoy running, bullet journaling, birding, and the occasional book.

# Project Highlights {.center-text-title}

Coming soon
