# Welcome 🐛 {.center-text-title}

<p class="center-text-about">

My name is Briana Barajas, and I am a currently a graduate student earning my Master's of Environmental Data Science. I am excited to tackle data-driven questions about conservation, and the changing landscape. Outside of coding, I spending my time [bird watching](https://briana-barajas.github.io/about.html#bird-watching), running, and reading.
