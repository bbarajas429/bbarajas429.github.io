## Motivation

Climate change, in conjunction with other environmental stressors, continue to threaten forests around the world. Mass tree deaths, fires, and deforestation can create a negative feedback loop, turning these well-recognized carbon sinks into a carbon source. Forests are also recognized for their role in preventing erosion, filtering air, and providing habitat and recreation.

Droughts have been proven to adversely affect forest health. Minimal and inconsistent water supply affects phenology and increases the chance of insect outbreaks or wildfires[^1]. While the severity of these threats is not novel to me, I recognized that most of my knowledge on the topic was based on studies conducted in temperate forests. I was curious to learn more about how droughts impacted tropical species, which are less adapted to severe weather fluctuations.

## Goal

To conduct a statistical assessment of tropical tree growth under drought conditions. This was accomplished using a series of linear regressions to model the relationship between tree growth and several climate variables. Using these regressions, I sought to examine if tree species with a widespread familial distribution (left) were better prepared for droughts than species with narrow familial distribution (right).

## Data

#### About the Data

Data of tree diameter over time is publicly available from the DataONE repository. This dataset includes measures of tree diameter at breast height (dbh) for several tropical tree species in the Luquillo National Research Forest in Puerto Rico. The Luquillo Forest is part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), so substantial meteorological data for the area was also available. The diameter measurements were taken during a severe drought, lasting from 2013 to 2016.

Although there were several climate variables available, I reduced the number of variables in the models to minimize the possibility of over fitting. Mean average temperature and total rainfall were included to summarize the effects of drought. Photosynthetic photon flux density (ppfd) was also included. PPFD is a measurement of the number of photons between 400 and 700 nm in wavelength, and how frequently these waves this the leaf's surface. This wavelength range is optimal for plant molecules to absorb, thus ppfd acts as a measurement of energy available for plants.[^2]

#### Tree Species

In an effort to minimize error, modeling was limited to the four most sampled tree species. Species were also selected based on their taxonomic family, and whether that family had a wide or narrow distribution. Species and family information was provided in the metadata, but I will summarize it here:

| Abbreviation |        Species        |    Family     | Family Distribution |
|:------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|    DACEXC    |  *Dacryodes excelsa*  | *Burseraceae* |       narrow        |
|    MANBID    | *Manilkara bidentata* | *Sapotaceae*  |       narrow        |
|    CASARB    |  *Casearia arborea*   | *Salicaceae*  |        wide         |
|    INGLAU    |    *Inga laurina*     |  *Fabaceae*   |        wide         |

#### Data Cleaning

Although data collection for tree diameters began in 2011, measurements were not consistently taken until June 2014. In order to create time series models without significant data gaps, I restricted the data from June 2014 to July 2016, when diameter data was collected monthly.

```{r}
## =====================================

## =====================================

dbh <- dbh_raw %>% 
  
  # correct date object format
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, doy, sep = "-"), "%Y-%j")) %>% 
  
  # filter to desired species
  filter(species %in% c("DACEXC", "MANBID", "CASARB", "INGLAU")) %>% 
  
  # calculate diameter averages per species
  select(-c("doy", "year", "flag")) %>% 
  group_by(date, species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_daily_dbh = mean(dbh, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # filter to desired time range
  filter(date(date) >= "2014-06-01" & date(date) < "2016-08-01")
  
# add family and distribution information
dbh <- dbh %>% 
  mutate(family = case_when(species == 'CASARB' ~ 'Salicaceae',
                            species == 'MANBID' ~ 'Sapotaceae',
                            species == 'DACEXC' ~ 'Burseraceae',
                            species == 'INGLAU' ~ 'Fabaceae'),
         distribution = case_when(family == 'Salicaceae' ~ 'wide',
                                  family == 'Sapotaceae' ~ 'narrow',
                                  family == 'Burseraceae' ~ 'narrow',
                                  family == 'Fabaceae' ~ 'wide'),
         distribution = as.factor(distribution))

```


Climate data that was collected daily had far more missing values than data collected hourly, so I used hourly climate data to calculate daily and monthly averages.

#### Exploration - Climate Trends

The following plots show time series decomposition from June 2014 to July 2016 for average monthly temperature and total monthly rainfall. The `seasonal_year` plot suggest that seasonality has a high contribution to changes in rainfall and temperature. By removing seasonal fluctuations, you can view the overall `trend` exhibited by the climate variables. The increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall display the symptoms of drought.

#### Rainfall Decomposition

```{r}
# decompose monthly rain variable
rain_dcmp <- monthly_conditions %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = year_mo) %>%
  model(STL(tot_rain_mm))

# plot 
components(rain_dcmp) %>% autoplot()
```

#### Temperature Decomposition

```{r}
# decompose monthly average temperature
temp_dcmp <- monthly_conditions %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = year_mo) %>% 
  model(STL(avg_temp_c))

# plot components
components(temp_dcmp) %>% autoplot()
```
:::


#### Exploration - Diameter Trends

Diameter trends for all species selected appear linear overall. Some species experienced faster relative growth, particularly CASARB and MANBID which had smaller diameters overall.

```{r}
ggplot(data = dbh, aes(x=date, y= mean_daily_dbh, col = distribution)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#3714ab', '#14A6AB'))+
  labs(y = "Diameter at Breast Height (mm)",
       title = "Mean Diameter of Species") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Distribution")) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  facet_wrap(~species, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

## Analysis - Static Time Series
In order to summarize the results I was most interested in, I developed the following function:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create function to run model and clean results
tidy_results_fun <- function(model, data){

  # clean model outputs
  tidy <- broom::tidy(model)
  summary <- broom::glance(model)
  
  # combine desired results
  tidy$adj_r_squared <- c(summary$adj.r.squared, NA)
  tidy$r_sqaured <- c(summary$r.squared, NA)
  
  # save results to environment
  assign(paste0(tolower(unique(data$species)), "_model"), tidy, envir = .GlobalEnv)

}

```

### Simple linear regression

A simple time series regression looking at tree diameter (y) over time (x) for the four species was conducted first. This can be written out mathematically as:$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1  $$

Where $\beta_1$ is the average change in diameter given a one unit change in time ($x_1$), and $\beta_0$ is the estimated diameter when time ($x_1$) is zero.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# source function
source(here("blog-posts", "2023-12-10-luquillo-drought", "tidy_results_function.R"))
```

```{r}
# apply function to all species
for (i in unique(clim_dbh_full$species)) {
  data <- clim_dbh_full %>% filter(species == i)
  model <- lm(mean_daily_dbh ~ date, data = data)
  tidy_results_fun(model, data)
}

# combine species based on distributions
wide <- rbind(inglau_model, casarb_model) %>% gt()
narrow <- rbind(dacexc_model, manbid_model) %>% gt()

# view for wide distribution
wide %>% 
  tab_header("Wide Familial Distribution") %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "I. laurina", rows = 1:2) %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "C. arborea", rows = 3:4) %>% 
  tab_options(row_group.background.color = "grey90")

# view results for narrow distribution
narrow %>% 
  tab_header("Wide Familial Distribution") %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "D. excelsa", rows = 1:2) %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "M. bidentata", rows = 3:4) %>% 
  tab_options(row_group.background.color = "grey90")
```

### Multiple Linear Regression

This regression compares diameter over time, adding all climate variables as predictors to see if the models predictive capability improves. This can be written out mathematically as:$$ \hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4$$

Where $x_2$ through $x_4$ are the added climate variables.

```{r}
# apply function to all species (now using multiple regression)
for (i in unique(clim_dbh_full$species)) {
  data <- clim_dbh_full %>% filter(species == i)
  model <- lm(mean_daily_dbh ~ date + tot_rain_mm + avg_temp_c + avg_ppfd_mmol_m2, data = data)
  tidy_results_fun(model, data)
}

# combine species based on distributions
wide <- rbind(inglau_model, casarb_model) %>% gt()
narrow <- rbind(dacexc_model, manbid_model) %>% gt()

# view for wide distribution
wide %>% 
  tab_header("Wide Familial Distribution") %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "I. laurina", rows = 1:2) %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "C. arborea", rows = 3:4) %>% 
  tab_options(row_group.background.color = "grey90")

# view results for narrow distribution
narrow %>% 
  tab_header("Wide Familial Distribution") %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "D. excelsa", rows = 1:2) %>% 
  tab_row_group(label = "M. bidentata", rows = 3:4) %>% 
  tab_options(row_group.background.color = "grey90")

```
