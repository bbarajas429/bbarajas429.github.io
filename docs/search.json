    "text": "Exploratory Maps\n\nTrue Color Image\nAssessing true color imagery before NDVI can be useful for quickly recognizing different types of terrain. Here, I created a simple true color image of the Santa Clara River area using one of a single Landsat from June 2018.\n\n\nCode\n# create a true color image\nplotRGB(single_landsat_rast, 3, 2, 1, stretch=\"hist\",\n        main = \"Santa Clara River True Color Image\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Site Location Along Santa Clara Watershed\nThe Santa Clara River flows from Santa Clarita to Ventura and remains relatively natural compared to other rivers in California. It is recognized for its ecological importance and natural resource potential, as the river provides water for agriculture and habitat for several endangered species. For these reasons, there have been significant efforts to conserve and restore the riparian habitat surrounding the river1.\nThe following visualization depicts the Santa Clara River, as well as other rivers within the Santa Clara Watershed. The plant communities (study sites) were added as well for geographical context.\n\n\nCode\n## ========== Data Preparation ==========\n# filter VC river data to SC watershed\nsc_watershed &lt;- vc_rivers %&gt;% \n  filter(WATERSHED == \"SANTA CLARA RIVER WATERSHED\") %&gt;% #filter\n  st_transform(crs = 'epsg:32611') %&gt;% #reproject\n  st_crop(study_sites)\n\n# filter state data to counties new watershed\nventura &lt;- states %&gt;% st_crop(study_sites) #crop county to watershed\n\n# create custom color palette\nphenology_pal &lt;- c(\"#EAAC8B\", \"#315C2B\", \"#315C2B\", \"#315C2B\",\"#9EA93F\")\n\n## ========== Plot Data Together ==========\n# create map combining watershed, study sites, and counties\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ventura, fill = '#E7DED9') +\n  geom_sf(data = sc_watershed, color = 'dodgerblue') +\n  geom_sf(data = study_sites,\n          mapping = aes(fill = study_site)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = phenology_pal) +\n  labs(title = \"Study Sites Along Santa Clara Watershed\",\n       fill = \"Plant Communities\",\n       x=NULL,\n       y=NULL) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill='lightblue'),\n        plot.margin=grid::unit(c(0,0,0,0), \"mm\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy Sites and NDVI\nThis map demonstrates study sites within a single NDVI layer. For simplicity, I will call the first layer from the all_ndvi raster stack.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(all_ndvi[[1]]) +\n  tm_raster() +\n  tm_shape(study_sites) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normalized vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to estimate plant productivity. Areas with sparse foliage will return lower values, while areas with dense leaf cover will return values closer to 1. The NDVI scale ranges from -1 to 1, but vegetation is commonly a positive value. A negative NDVI is indicative of water, either as clouds, snow, or bodies of water on the Earth’s surface. For this reason, cloud cover can potentially affect NDVI values calculated from remotely sensed data."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nHigher NDVI values often correlate with denser vegetation and times of rapid growth. Based on the plot produced, grasslands and chaparral sites appear to have faster growth in the springtime. Most notably, however, it appears that grasslands are ill equipped for winter as the NDVI from the end of 2018 is rather low. To expand this analysis, it would be useful to data beyond just one year. It is possible this year was not an accurate representation, and additional data would uncover this. With enough data, you could also minimize seasonal cycles to uncover trends that are only visible over several years."

    "text": "About the Data\nFor the final visualizations, I used two different data frames within the same data publication by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The first data frame contained the data on CMR surveys of the Oregon Spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) from 2009-2021. The raw data was in “long” format, where every year and visit number were an individual column of 0s and 1s, indicating whether or not an individual was captured. Using pivot_longer , I split year and visit number into individual columns. This allowed me to easily sum the data so that I could count the number of frogs detected based on particular groups (reach, sex, and size).\nThe second data frame contained data on environmental variables around the time the surveys were conducted. I only focused on the NDVI column in this data set, as I hypothesized that vegetation density might impact the ease of catching frogs. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife service also hosts a geographic data set with the species range of several threatened, and endangered species. I used the species range data to create a custom range map for the infographic.\n\nRead in data\n\n\nCode\n## ========================================\n##             Read in Data            ----\n## ========================================\n# set data directory\ndata_dir &lt;- \"/Users/bri_b/Documents/Work/bb-website/bbarajas429.github.io/blog-posts/2024-03-12-frog-infrographic/data\"\n\n# read frog data ----\nfrogs_raw &lt;- read_csv(here(data_dir, \"frog_cmr\", \"cmrData.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\n# read water data ----\nenv_raw &lt;- read_csv(here(data_dir, \"frog_cmr\", \"waterCov.csv\"))\n\n# species range data ----\nquery &lt;- \"SELECT * FROM usfws_complete_species_current_range_2 WHERE SCINAME='Rana pretiosa' \"\n\nrange_map &lt;- st_read(here(data_dir, \"usfws_complete_species_current_range\",\n                          \"usfws_complete_species_current_range_2.shp\"),\n                     query = query) %&gt;%\n  st_make_valid() %&gt;%\n  clean_names()\n\n# full state maps ----\nstate_map &lt;- st_read(here(data_dir, \"cb_2018_us_state_500k\", \"cb_2018_us_state_500k.shp\")) %&gt;%\n  st_make_valid() %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  filter(name == \"Oregon\" | name == \"Washington\")\n\n# create a coordinate point for data collection area\ndata_location &lt;- data.frame(lat = c(43.224875),\n                            lon = c(-121.587244)) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\"), crs = st_crs(state_map))\n\n## ========================================\n##             Read in Images          ----\n## ========================================\n# frog icons ----\nfrog_female &lt;- here(data_dir, \"frog-female.png\")\nfrog_male &lt;- here(data_dir, \"frog-male.png\")\n\n# jack creek map ----\ncreek_img &lt;- png::readPNG(here(data_dir, \"jack-creek-inset.png\"), native = TRUE)\n\n# sul image ----\nsul_img &lt;- png::readPNG(here(data_dir, \"sul-measurement.png\"), native = TRUE)\n\n# lilypad image ----\nyellow_pad &lt;- here(data_dir, \"yellow-pad.png\")\ngreen_pad &lt;- here(data_dir, \"green-pad.png\")\n\n# lilypad legend ----\nlilypad_legend &lt;- png::readPNG(here(data_dir, \"lilypad-legend.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\n\n\nCode\n## ========================================\n##        Wrangle environmental data   ----\n## ========================================\nenv &lt;- env_raw %&gt;% \n  \n  # select sites of interest (most surveyed)\n  filter(reach == \"Middle Jack\" | reach == \"Upper Jamison\")\n\n## ========================================\n##          Wrangle frog CMR data      ----\n## ========================================\nfrogs &lt;- frogs_raw %&gt;% \n  \n  # filter to most surveyed reaches\n  filter(reach == \"Middle Jack\" | reach == \"Upper Jamison\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # pivot to split year from detected column\n  pivot_longer(cols = 5:43,\n               names_to = \"year_visit\",\n               values_to = \"frog_detected\") %&gt;% \n  \n  # split year and visit number into two columns %&gt;% \n  separate(year_visit, \n           c(\"year\", \"visit\"),\n           '_') %&gt;% \n  \n  # remove x that precedes the year (x2010, x2011)\n  mutate(year = str_remove(year, 'x')) %&gt;% \n  \n  # rename size to include units\n  rename(sul_mm = sul) %&gt;% \n  \n  # remove years w/no frog surveys at Upper Jamison\n  filter(year %in% c(2009:2019))\n\n\n# clean environment\nrm(env_raw, frogs_raw, query)"

    "text": "Creating Data Visualizations\n\nSpecies Range Map\nThe species range map was not one of the key visualizations, and required minimal data wrangling. The USFWS dataset included ranges for all threatened or endangered species, so I used a query to select only the Oregon Spotted Frog range. To better demonstrate the study area, I added an inset map with labeled locations of interest. This map is an image from the original publication and has the site names clearly labeled which would be important for the “vegetation” figure.\n\n\nCode\n# create species range map\nggplot() +\n  \n  # map states & species range\n  geom_sf(data = state_map, col = \"slategray\") +\n  geom_sf(data = range_map, fill = \"yellowgreen\", col = \"black\") +\n  \n  # add box around study area \n  geom_sf(data = data_location, shape = 15, size = 6, col = \"dodgerblue\",\n          alpha = 0.45) +\n  \n  # add text annotation for study area\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = -118, y = 45.4, label = \"Study Area \\n Jack Creek, Oregon\", family = \"noto\", size = 4, col = \"black\") +\n  \n  # expand axis limits so inset image does not get cropped\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-125, -116), ylim = c(41.5, 49.5), expand = FALSE) +\n  \n  # add lines connecting study area to inset map\n  geom_curve(aes(x = -120, xend = -121.50,\n                 y = 44.98, yend = 43.224875),\n             curvature = 0, col = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  \n  geom_curve(aes(x = -120, xend = -121.50,\n                 y = 43.02, yend = 43.224875),\n             curvature = 0, col = \"black\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  \n  # add map of study area\n  annotation_raster(creek_img, xmax = -120, xmin = -116,\n                    ymax = 45, ymin = 43) +\n  \n  # update general theme to remove background\n  theme_void() +\n  \n  # add title\n  labs(title = \"Species Range Map\") +\n  \n  # adjust title theme and size\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0, \n                                  family = \"roboto\", size = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMales vs. Females\nSince I was comparing counts, I decided I would create a unique version of a bar chart. I was originally looking at lollipop charts when I got the idea to connect the point to a curved line, so it appeared as though the frog was jumping. Since the data presented in this plot was so simple, I wanted to remove as many of the plot elements as possible. For example, instead of a legend I directly wrote out the frog counts by each point. I also made the male and female frog different colors, which I kept consistent in the final inforgraphic caption. Additionally, after calculating the sum I changed the sex column to be the same character string so both frogs would both be on the same axis.\n\n\nCode\n## ............. Data Preparation..................\n# create data subset of male vs. female frogs captured\nmf_count &lt;- frogs %&gt;% \n  group_by(sex) %&gt;% \n  summarise(frog_catch = sum(frog_detected))\n\n# add column with male/female frog images\nmf_count$image &lt;- c(frog_female, frog_male)\n\n# change sex to same value so frogs can be on the same line\nmf_count$sex &lt;- \"A\"\n\n## ..................Plot..........................\n\n# create plot of male vs. female frogs caught\nggplot(data = mf_count) +\n  \n  # add images of frogs for male and female\n  geom_image(aes(x = frog_catch, y = sex, image = image), \n             size = 0.2) +\n  \n  # add hop line for males\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 0, xend = 267, y = 1, yend = 1), linetype = 2,\n             curvature = -0.4, col = \"#18BA9A\", linewidth = 1) +\n  \n  # add hop line for females\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 0, xend = 350, y = 1, yend = 1), linetype = 2,\n             curvature = -0.4, col = \"#754edb\", linewidth = 1) +\n  \n  # expand x-axis to add space for text\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 360)) +\n  \n  # pre-set theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n  # customize labels and title\n  labs(title = \"Sex of Captured Frogs\") +\n  \n  # add labels for data points\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 342.5, y = 0.87, label = \"350 female frogs\", \n           family = \"noto\", size = 4, col = \"#754edb\") +\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", x = 259, y = 0.87, label = \"267 male frogs\",\n           family = \"noto\", size = 4, col = \"#18BA9A\") +\n  \n  # remove gridlines\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        \n        # remove labels that aren't needed\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        \n        # customize fonts\n        plot.title = element_text(family = \"roboto\", size = 30,\n                                  hjust = 0.5, vjust = -9.5),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize Distribution\nSince frog size is a continuous variable, I wanted to focus on which sizes were most common instead of calculating totals. Ideally, the distribution of frogs caught would be normally distributed, so I used arrows and notes to highlight where this was not the case. I chose the green color to continue the frog theme, and kept all my annotations black so they popped against the white background. I decided to keep the gridlines so the two peaks could be easily compared. Different species have different standards for being measured, so I wanted to include an image that shows how the frogs were measured. Frogs are measured from snout to urostyle. Instead of defining urostyle, I summarized this measurement as “length” for simplicity.\n\n\nCode\n## ............. Data Preparation..................\n# subset to only include frogs that were captured\nfrogs_subset &lt;- frogs %&gt;% \n  filter(frog_detected == 1)\n\n## ..................Plot..........................\n# plot density of frog size\nggplot(frogs_subset, aes(x = sul_mm)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"#4EA72E\", col =\"seagreen\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  \n  # change standard theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n  # update axis titles\n  labs(y = \"Density\", \n       x = \"Length (mm)\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Frog Length\") +\n  \n  # update text font and size\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(family = \"noto\", size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"noto\", size = 14),\n        plot.title = element_text(family = \"roboto\",\n                                  hjust = 0.5, size = 30, vjust = 1),\n        \n        # increase plot margin\n        plot.margin = margin(1,0,0,0, \"cm\")) +\n  \n  # update plot to start at y-axis\n  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0, 0)) +\n  \n  # add arrow pointing to most common sizes\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 47.6, xend = 53,\n                 y = 0.047, yend = 0.045),\n             curvature = 0.2, arrow = grid::arrow()) +\n  \n  # add note on common frog sizes\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", family = \"noto\", size = 3,\n           label = \"Most captured frogs\\n were between 53 - 55 mm \\n in length\",\n           x = 46, y = 0.051) +\n  \n  # add image for measuring frog lengths\n  annotation_raster(sul_img, xmax = 82, xmin = 72,\n                    ymax = 0.052, ymin = 0.033)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetation\nFor vegetation, I wanted to highlight several parts of the data including year, average summer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and frog count. To avoid overly complex figures, I decided to focus only on NDVI over time and compare frog counts directly within the graphic. I originally created a line graph that demonstrated NDVI over time for both sites. I decided against this, because I was more interested in displaying the difference not changes. Instead of the line graph, I opted for a dumbell plot to better demonstrate theses differences. I wanted the data points to look like lilypads in a pond. Since Middle Jack has more dense vegetation (higher NDVI), I made the leaf more green than the one for Upper Jamison. I also know that NDVI is not an intuitive variable, so I added a line at 0 and text highlighting that values above zero indicate more dense vegetation.\n\n\nCode\n## ............. Data Preparation..................\n# prepare NDVI data for dumbell plot\nenv_db_data &lt;- env %&gt;% \n  filter(year &lt;= 2019) %&gt;% \n  select(c(\"year\", \"mdNDVI\", \"reach\")) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = reach, values_from = mdNDVI) %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = as.factor(year),\n         leaf = green_pad,\n         dry_leaf = yellow_pad)\n\n## ..................Plot..........................\n# create dumbell plot of annual NDVI\nggplot(env_db_data) +\n  \n  # add line for 0 axis\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 3) +\n  \n  # add lines to connect NDVI of different sites\n  geom_segment(aes(y = middle_jack, yend = upper_jamison,\n                   x = year, xend = year), \n               \n               linewidth = 0.7, col = \"slategray\") +\n  \n  # add points as images\n  geom_image(aes(x = year, y = middle_jack,\n                 image = leaf), size = 0.08) +\n  geom_image(aes(x = year, y = upper_jamison,\n                 image = dry_leaf), size = 0.08) +\n  \n  # change to standard theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n  # update axis names and titles\n  labs(y = \"NDVI\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       title = \"Average Summer NDVI\") +\n  \n  # update theme\n  # update background and grid color\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"aliceblue\",\n                                        color = \"lightblue3\",\n                                        linewidth = 1),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"azure2\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = \"azure2\"),\n        \n        # update fonts and text size\n        plot.title = element_text(family = \"roboto\", size = 30, \n                                  hjust = 0.5),\n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"noto\", size = 16),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"noto\", size = 14)) +\n  \n  # add annotation to provide information for NDVI\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", size = 4, family = \"noto\",\n           label = \"Dense vegetation \\n Sparse vegetation\",\n           x = 7, y = 0, col = \"blue\") +\n  \n  # add legend \n  annotation_raster(lilypad_legend, xmin = 8.7, xmax = 11,\n                    ymin = 2, ymax = 1.1) +\n  \n  # increase x-axis length\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,11)) +\n  \n  # increase spacing between x-axis ticks\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, -11))"

    "text": "Data\n\nAbout the Data\nData on tree diameter changes were available through the DataONE interface. This dataset includes measures of tree diameter at breast height (dbh) for several tropical tree species in the Luquillo National Research Forest in Puerto Rico. I chose this data since the Luquillo Forest is part of the Long-Term Ecological Research Network, and meteorological data in this area was well recorded. Additionally, these diameter measurements were taken during a notable drought, lasting from 2013-2016. \nTo avoid model overfitting, I only wanted to include climate variables that both represent drought conditions and have a potentially larger impact on tree growth. I used mean average temperature and total rainfall to relate tree growth and drought. I also decided to include photosynthetic photon flux density (ppfd), since it directly relates to plants. PPFD is a measure of the number of photons between the 400 and 700nm wavelengths that are hitting surfaces per unit time. These wavelengths are optimal for plant molecules to absorb2.\n\n\nTree Species\nTo improve predictive capabilities, I selected the four most sampled species that fell within one of two categories for familial distribution. Species and family information was pulled from the metadata, but I will summarize it here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\nSpecies\nFamily\nFamily Distribution\n\n\n\n\nDACEXC\nDacryodes excelsa\nBurseraceae\nnarrow\n\n\nMANBID\nManilkara bidentata\nSapotaceae\nnarrow\n\n\nCASARB\nCasearia arborea\nSalicaceae\nwide\n\n\nINGLAU\nInga laurina\nFabaceae\nwide\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nAlthough data collection for tree diameters began in 2011, measurements were not consistently taken until June 2014. In order to create time series models without significant data gaps, I restricted the data from June 2014 to July 2016, when diameter data was collected monthly.\nClimate data that was collected daily had far more missing values than data collected hourly, so I used hourly climate data to calculate daily and monthly averages.\n\n\nCode\n## ======== Convert Hourly Data to Lower Res =====\n# convert hourly climate to daily averages\ndaily_conditions &lt;- hourly_conditions %&gt;% \n  group_by(date = date(datetime)) %&gt;% \n  summarise(tot_rain_mm = sum(rain_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n            avg_temp_c = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE),\n            avg_ppfd_mmol_m2 = mean(ppfd_mmol_m2_hour, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n   mutate(year_mo = yearmonth(date))\n\n# create monthly conditions\nmonthly_conditions &lt;- hourly_conditions %&gt;% \n  group_by(year_mo) %&gt;% \n  summarise(tot_rain_mm = sum(rain_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\n            avg_temp_c = mean(temp_c, na.rm = TRUE),\n            avg_ppfd_mmol_m2 = mean(ppfd_mmol_m2_hour, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# replace zeros w/NA, no data collected October 2014\nmonthly_conditions['tot_rain_mm'][monthly_conditions['tot_rain_mm'] == 0] &lt;- NA\n\n# replace NAs with the mean of previous and next month\nmonthly_conditions$tot_rain_mm &lt;- na.approx(monthly_conditions$tot_rain_mm)\n\n# remove raw data variables\nrm(clim_1999_2014, clim_2015_2023, dbh_raw, hourly_conditions)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# create fully joined df\nclim_dbh_full &lt;- left_join(dbh, daily_conditions, by = c('date','year_mo'))\n\n\n\n\nExploration - Climate Trends\nThe following plots show time series decomposition from June 2014 to July 2016 for average monthly temperature and total monthly rainfall.

    "text": "Results\nAfter running several regressions, I found that increasing complexity rarely improved the model. In fact, the simple static time series for C. arborea (CASARB) was one of the most accurate, with a model that explained 70% of variation in diameter growth (y). CASARB has the largest increase in mean diameter height between the first and last measurement, and I believe this is what produced such a well-fitting model. Given more time, I predict that time alone would be a much better indicator of diameter growth than what is demonstrated here. All species except M. bidentata (MANBID) experienced decreases in adjusted r-squared values when climate variables were added. This suggests climate variables were likely excessive and caused overfitting, but the one exception is interesting. By adding climate variables, the new MANBID model explained 30% of variation in diameter, as opposed to 12% in the initial model. While this percentage is still rather low, it suggests potential discrepancies between which tree species are more rapidly impacted by climate."

    "text": "Limitations\nGiven more time, I would have analyzed the change in diameter at breast height between measurements instead of dbh itself. This could potentially reduce autocorrelation, so a dynamic time series could be run instead. Alternatively, an auto regressive moving average (or ARIMA) model would allow me to compare these changes regardless of the high autocorrelation. As mentioned, I suspect that data collected over a longer period of time would demonstrate a stronger linear relationship between tree diameter and time. To expand this analysis, growth rates during periods of drought could be compared to rates during favorable climate conditions."

I have continued to bird watch ever since, and keep track of my sightings using the Merlin and eBird apps, which are maintained by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\nI thought it would be fun to visualize my personal bird sightings using a leaflet map:\n\n\nCode\n# add CRS to lat/long points\nbirds &lt;- birds %&gt;%   st_as_sf(coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = 'EPSG:4236')\n\n# create map\nbirds %&gt;% \n  leaflet() %&gt;% \n  addProviderTiles(providers$Jawg.Streets,\n                   options = providerTileOptions(accessToken = token)) %&gt;% \n  addMarkers(label = birds$common_name,\n             popup = paste0(birds$common_name, ' (',\n                            birds$scientific_name, ')'),\n             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),\n             icon = makeIcon(iconUrl = iconpath,\n                             iconWidth = 32, iconHeight = 32))"
